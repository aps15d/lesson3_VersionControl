            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git stores and processes information differently than other programs even if the user interface is pretty much the same. Git could be compared to Version Control Systems, but the real difference is how Git processes its data. Most systems store information as a list of file-based changes. They think of the information as a set of files and the changes made over time. Git processes its data like a set of pictures of a small filesystem. Each time you save (commit) the state of your project in Git, it’s essentially taking a picture of what the files look like at that time and stores a reference to that picture.</div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When I first read this I was expecting the history to start out something like how someone with “Git” in their last name came up with the idea, but I was far from what actually happened. The Linux kernel is an open source software project that’s pretty big. It lasted from 1991-2002 and changes were made throughout the years to the software. The Linux kernel project started using a distributed version control system called BitKeeper in 2002. Git came about in 2005 when the relationship between the Linux kernel company and the BitKeeper company broke down. This community then came together to come up with some new ideas for a new system that would soon become the program we use today.</div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a bunch of different commands that go along with Git. First off is ‘Git Init’ means initialize the repository. “Git Add .” is adding all the files that were changed since the last back up to the staging area. “Git Commit –M …” is committing the changes to the repository. Two really important commands are the push and pull commands. The Git Push command is pushing the changes in local repository to the remote repository and the Git Pull command pulls the changes in a remote repository to local repository. Lastly the Git Log shows all the backups created in the repository so that’s good to be able to keep track.</div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Like me, if you don’t know what a repository is before beginning trying to understand this topic, I highly suggest getting pretty familiar with the word. A repository, to my best understanding, is that it’s basically a storage space where your projects can live, according to ReadWrite’s article “GitHub for Beginners.” It can be as small as a folder on your computer or as large as an online host such as GitHub. Here you are able to store code files, text files, image files, etc. It sounds like it almost kind of relates to the cloud in a way (when it’s online) because it’s storing many things through the internet.

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control was the first main topic I learned about in this lesson. It is a system that records changes to a file or set of files overtime so that you can recall specific versions later. This is especially helpful to graphic and/or web designers when trying to keep every single version of an image or layout. This is super important when trying to revert projects back to a previous layout/state. There are three different version control systems, local, centralized, and distributed. They’re all relatively similar but local version control systems are strictly for people doing simpler tasks like copying files into another directory. Centralized version control systems are for people who need to collaborate. Distributed version control systems are really cool because the clients have fully mirrored repositories.</div>
